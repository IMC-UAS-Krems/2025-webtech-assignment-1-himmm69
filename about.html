                                 I also really enjoy spending nights reading novels, especially fantasy novels. My interest in novels became prevalent when 
                                 I was 13 years old, and my Masi (mother's sister) bought me a copy of the Philosopher's Stone from the Harry 
                                  Potter series. y favourite book of the series was the 3rd book, The Prisoner of Azkaban, as it introduced the character Sirius Black.

                                   Mistborn is one of the best fantasy novels I’ve read
                                  far beyond Harry Potter or Percy Jackson. It follows Vin, 
                                  a street rogue who joins a revolutionary named Kelsier to overthrow a corrupt empire.
                                   The story shines through its incredible world-building and a unique magic system based 
                                   on metals that grant special powers. I’d highly recommend it to any fantasy lover.
