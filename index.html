        Hello,my name is Parth Gandhi, I am 18 years old originally from a big city in India called mumbai 
        I moved to Veinna in 2023 and complted my highschool from Veinna International School. I have then joined IMC 
        to pursue the Infomatics Course. A bit aboutmyself I have always been fasicated by technology and always 
        admired software and programs. One of my fondest childhood memeories was at being amazed as how everything
        I enjoyed virtually as in Video games, Vidoe platform like youtube etc were also 'coded' in these special languages
        only computers undersatnd and from there I was set keen on exploring and learning the knowdlege of these special languages 
        that we now call as programing languages.
